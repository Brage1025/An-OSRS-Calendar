# OSRS Calendar

![App Screenshot](./assets/OSRS-Calendar-Screenshot.png)

A simple desktop calendar app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ElectronJS.  
This project is styled and inspired by the MMORPG _Old School RuneScape_, made by Jagex.

## How to use

### 1. Clone This Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Brage1025/An-OSRS-Calendar.git
cd An OSRS Calendar
```

### 2. Install Node.js

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

```
npm install
```

This should install Electron and any other modules required to run the app.

### 3. Run the App Locally

```
npm run start
```

This will open An OSRS Calendar as a desktop application powered by Electron.

## Features

- **Old School RuneScape Aesthetic**: Authentic color palette and images scraped from RuneLite and edited to fit the project by me.
- **Authentic Text Font**: Uses the official OSRS text font.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Designed to fit almost any desktop while bringing that OSRS vibe.

## What Electron Template Did I Use?

I used this template by Nasha Wanich:  
https://github.com/nasha-wanich/electron-app-template

Her repository provides a super simple boilerplate. I used it to build an Electron desktop app, so why not download the repo and try to make an even better one than this?

### Special Thanks

- To the RuneScape guild [Unparagoned](https://secure.runescape.com/m=clan-home/clan/Unparagoned) for all the support, both in-game and out.

### Potentially Planned Features

- [ ] None
