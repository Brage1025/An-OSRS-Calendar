A simple desktop calendar app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ElectronJS.  
This project is styled and inspired by the MMORPG _Old School RuneScape_, made by Jagex.

## How to use

### 1. Clone This Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Brage1025/An-OSRS-Calendar.git
cd An-OSRS-Calendar
```

### 2. Install Node.js

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

```
npm install

This should install Electron and any other modules required to run the app.

## What Electron Template Did I Use?

I used this template by Nasha Wanich:  
https://github.com/nasha-wanich/electron-app-template

Her repository provides a super simple boilerplate. This template provided a clean starting point for building an Electron desktop app and is highly recommended for beginners exploring Electron development.

### Special Thanks
